            <p>Hi, I’m Lisa and welcome to my first bit of homework on my coding “journey”.</p>
            <p>So my background is in Finance/Economics and I’d been working at a Wealth Management company in Finance and Accounting roles for most of my career before I learned what a Business Analyst and thought, ‘That sounds like a pretty sweet gig, I could do that!’. So, I started getting involved in some projects and managed to score some awesome business analysis secondments within Finance that gave me great exposure to things like data analysis/reporting, process improvement, workflow automation etc.. It was enough of a taster to affirm that IT was where I wanted to be but breaking into IT with that company was difficult for a number of reasons. </p>
            <p>I was approached about a Business Analyst role in IT for a smaller Wealth Management company two and a half years ago, and I just went for it. Best move ever (apart from moving from Perth). </p>
            <p>It’s been a massive learning curve moving from Finance to IT. The culture, values, personalities, lingo, way of working, way of thinking, are all so different from Finance. In my view, everything is an upgrade from what I used to do and I would never go back. Every day is different now. I get paid to solve problems and build cool stuff with brilliant, supportive and hilarious kids. I’m learning new things all the time and it doesn’t stop. </p>
            <p>One side effect of working with awesome Devs is that knowing first-hand what they can do/make, and I want to do it too. Just as I felt when I realised I wanted to be a BA, I know it’s a sweet gig and I can do it. So here I am, challenged and loving it.</p>
